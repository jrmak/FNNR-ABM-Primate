All runs should be automatically stored in this folder.

Zip the entire file and send over Google Drive, or zip as many as you can up to 25 mb to send in separate emails.

Don't worry about organizing runs.

Any incomplete runs are stored outside of this folder, in the main folder, and are deleted automatically at the start of the next run.
